# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the approach for removing specific containers from the Therapy Field User Portal to create a cleaner, more focused interface.

## Architecture

The modifications will be made to the `user-panel.html` file by:
1. Removing all content containers from the `dashboard-sections` div
2. Removing specific appointment-related sections from the `sessions-sections` div

## Components and Interfaces

### Dashboard Section Cleanup
- **Target**: `#dashboard-sections` container
- **Action**: Remove all child sections while preserving the container structure
- **Preserved**: Navigation functionality and section switching logic

### Therapy Section Cleanup  
- **Target**: Appointment-related containers within `#sessions-sections`
- **Sections to Remove**:
  - "Upcoming Appointments" section
  - "Previous Sessions" section
- **Preserved**: All therapist finding functionality, search options, and booking system

## Data Models

No data model changes required as we're only removing UI containers, not modifying data structures.

## Error Handling

- Ensure navigation between tabs continues to work
- Verify that JavaScript functions don't reference removed elements
- Maintain responsive design after container removal

## Testing Strategy

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify navigation works after container removal
2. **UI Testing**: Confirm clean appearance of modified tabs
3. **Regression Testing**: Ensure other functionality remains intact
4. **Responsive Testing**: Verify mobile layout still works properly
