# Fix Berlin Country Filter Issue - Requirements

## Introduction

The user portal's Therapy Tab - Criteria step shows "Greece,Berlin" in the city dropdown filter instead of the correct "Germany,Berlin". Despite multiple existing fix attempts, the issue persists, indicating a deeper systematic problem that needs comprehensive analysis and resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Diagnostic Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the root cause of why Berlin therapists are showing as "Greece,Berlin" instead of "Germany,Berlin" in the city filter dropdown, so that I can implement an effective fix.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze the therapist data THEN I SHALL identify if Berlin therapists have correct country assignments in the source data
2. WHEN I trace the filter population process THEN I SHALL identify which script is creating the incorrect "Greece,Berlin" entries
3. WHEN I examine script execution order THEN I SHALL identify timing conflicts between multiple filter scripts
4. WHEN I check browser developer tools THEN I SHALL identify any JavaScript errors or console warnings related to filter population
5. WHEN I analyze localStorage/sessionStorage THEN I SHALL identify if cached data is causing the incorrect assignments

### Requirement 2: Data Integrity Fix

**User Story:** As a user navigating to the Therapy Tab - Criteria step, I want to see "Germany,Berlin" in the city filter dropdown, so that I can correctly filter for Berlin-based therapists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Berlin therapists exist in the data THEN they SHALL have country field set to "Germany"
2. WHEN Berlin area therapists exist (Charlottenburg, Mitte) THEN they SHALL have country field set to "Germany"
3. WHEN the city filter is populated THEN Berlin entries SHALL display as "Germany, Berlin"
4. WHEN the city filter is populated THEN there SHALL be no "Greece, Berlin" entries
5. WHEN I select "Germany, Berlin" from the filter THEN it SHALL correctly filter to show only Berlin therapists

### Requirement 3: Script Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure only one authoritative script handles the city filter population, so that multiple scripts don't conflict and create incorrect entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple filter scripts are loaded THEN only one SHALL be responsible for final filter population
2. WHEN filter scripts execute THEN they SHALL execute in the correct order to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN a filter script runs THEN it SHALL not be overridden by subsequent scripts
4. WHEN the criteria step initializes THEN the filter population SHALL be deterministic and consistent
5. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the filter SHALL consistently show correct country assignments

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the Berlin country filter fix works consistently across different scenarios, so that the issue doesn't reoccur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to Therapy Tab - Criteria step THEN Berlin SHALL show as "Germany, Berlin"
2. WHEN I refresh the page and navigate to criteria THEN Berlin SHALL consistently show as "Germany, Berlin"
3. WHEN I clear browser cache and reload THEN Berlin SHALL still show as "Germany, Berlin"
4. WHEN I select "Germany, Berlin" filter THEN it SHALL show Berlin therapists with German addresses
5. WHEN I check browser console THEN there SHALL be no errors related to country assignment

### Requirement 5: Prevention of Regression

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement safeguards that prevent the "Greece,Berlin" issue from reoccurring, so that future code changes don't break the country assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new therapist data is added THEN country assignments SHALL be validated automatically
2. WHEN filter scripts are modified THEN country mapping SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be validation to ensure no incorrect country assignments exist
4. WHEN incorrect assignments are detected THEN they SHALL be automatically corrected
5. WHEN the system runs THEN there SHALL be logging to track country assignment corrections
